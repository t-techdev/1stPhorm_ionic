    <p>This is a planned meal diet plan. Once you are comfortable with Portion Control, you should move on to the Meal
      Plan to improve your results.</p>
    <p>This meal plan builds upon the Portion Control plan by giving you specific portions that are calculated based on
      your current weight and your goal (lose, maintain, or gain).</p>
    <p>You can stay on this plan as long as you are comfortable. You might stay on this plan until you are ready to
      switch your goal to maintain, or just until you feel comfortable enough making good food choices.</p>
