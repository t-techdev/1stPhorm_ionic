    <h1>Warm Up</h1>
    <p>A warm-up serves two major purposesâ€”to enhance your workout and prevent injury. Consequently, a
      warm-up is both physical and mental. You want to get the blood flowing which in turn will increase your core
      temperature. As you do this the goal will be to "prime" your body and muscles to move with greater range of
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good goal is that your warm up should make you physically feel warm and even starting to break a sweat. A good
      common practice is to hop on your favorite piece of cardio equipment for 5 minutes. Slowly increasing your effort
      of that time frame working into a moderate to challenging effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a simple, full body warm up. Proceed through the following 2 or more times. This is NOT a race or for
      time. Focus on good movement patterns and proper range of motion.

      As You start the actual workout, make sure to warm up the movement you are going to do. For example: Before
      starting your 3 sets of Back Squats, do a warm up set of Back Squats using very little or no weight for 20 to
      30
      reps. Then do your working sets of Back Squats and move on to Leg Press. Before beginning the sets of Leg
      Press,
      perform a warm up set with very little to no weight for 20-30 reps. Then begin your 4 sets of Leg Press. When
      Finished move on to the next exercise, performing a warm up set before, and repeat this for each exercise.

    <h1>Cool-Down</h1>
    <p>A cool down is an essential part of your workout. A cool down typically last for 3-12 minutes. The purpose of a
      quality cool down after your workout is to allow your heart rate and breathing to return to normal, decrease
      potential joint or muscle soreness, and set your body up for a great workout next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your cool down will be based off the type of workout you preformed and the muscle you work. A good general cool
      down would be using jogging, walking, or using your favorite piece of cardio equipment for 2-3 minutes at a
      brisk
      to moderate pace. Reducing the effort every 30-45 seconds to where you find yourself "walking" or at a casual
      pace on the equipment.
