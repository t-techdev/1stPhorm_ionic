      1st Phorm Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs
      – that allow 1st Phorm to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. 1st Phorm
      may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have
      been opened and acted upon. Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help
      determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used
      by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to
      recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation
      to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails
      bring you to our website and how you use the site. 1st Phorm prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or
      access your personal information.
